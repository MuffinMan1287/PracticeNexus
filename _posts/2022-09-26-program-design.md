title: Program Design and Development

# Video Notes
- Need an idea for what a program should do
- Each program will have a specific purpose in mind
- Developers need to stick take specific steps and stick to a plan
- Development can be exploratory and see what happen
- Can start investigating issues and what a program can accomplish
- Determine requirements of problem
- Understand constraints of the project(ex. technology, time, money)
- Take into account user concerns and interests
- Surveying, testing, interviewing, observations can help individuals determine the program and issues or uses
- Developers have many ways of brainstorming and planning
- Storyboard program, plan user experience, layout user interface, organizing into modules, and have a testing strategy
- Will describe how the program should work and what it will do
- Developers often create prototypes and use an incremental process
- Important to test the program(at micro level, at macro level, with user), and reflect on and revise program
---
- Program development usually requires input from multiple individuals
- Big project: Many individuals
- Components: Smaller groups or individuals
- Important to credit contributions, names must be written in documentation
- Often use comments to give credit
- Giving credit can help find the correct people to fix bugs or issues in the program
- A program will oftentimes take parts from previous programs, such as code segments, procedures, and algorithms
- Need to give credit to other individuals, state author name and source
- Can create a form of a bibliography in documentation
---
- Documentation is often created by programmers
- Documentation: written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed
- Purposes:
- Describe the program
- list program requirements and/or specifications
- describe: methods in code, list of events and other actions, development of the program, how other programs can interact
- contributions and other authors
- Documentation happens throughout the program
- Beginning: list specifications; During: track progress; After: explain process
- Can help efficiency, program purpose, and response to bugs
- Documentation is often done through commenting
- Good commenting helps with individual and group work
