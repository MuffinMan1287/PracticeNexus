This file should appear as a post on the site. **Is this bold?** The usage of .docx files will be very useful for things like storing assignments, especially for other classes. Could also be useful for taking and uploading notes and definitions for CSP.

It is very easy to upload posts using the docx files. Just drag and drop the file, and a new post is created. However, it is harder to format and give tags to. Maybe that is a project for the future, learning how to format and tag docx files.

Thatâ€™s all for now\!
