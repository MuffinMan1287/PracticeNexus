# My Flask Changes

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/flaskedit1.png "Frontpage changed")

I changed the frontpage of my Flask Repository. I added a new card with a new image, and linked my fastpage to the button. I also changed the name of the navigation tab.

I also changed the Stub, naming it "NotStub." I added a table, and some images. The table used special styling.

# Team Flask Changes

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Flasktable.png "Team Flask Changes")

We changed the labeling, and also created a new program purpose page. We had an image with our main purpose, and it showed words after hovering over it. We also added a table illustrating how the Create Task idea matches CollegeBoard requirements.
