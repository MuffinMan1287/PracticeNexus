# Video Notes
- Every program has a purpose
- Innovations can come in different categories: Applications(Games, Social Media), Physical Devices(Computers, Smart Phones), Systems(ex. E-mail, E-commerce)
- Help to do things in a better way, to help people

*Guiding Questions*
- Why does the innovation exist?
- What problem or issue does the computing innovation solve?
- What does the innovation allow us to do which couldn't be done before?

- Programs input can come from users or other programs
- Outputs come in various ways
- Output is usually based on internal values of program
- Event driven programming: program statements are executed when triggered, not a sequential flow
- Inputs can be tactile, audio, visual, text
- Events are triggered by action, can send input to the program.
- Inputs usually affect the outputs which come from a device.
- Action triggers an event -> Program goes to a certain code segment according to the event -> Executes the segment -> Output is triggered by the code segment
- Code is executed as they are called.

- A program(or called software) is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer.
- Group of statements: a code statement
- Based on the rules of programming language.
- Important to describe code segments
- Describe the segments function and ability
- Also explain how the segment is able to function

# Hacks
- We have a final project idea for the PBL Web Project. Our idea will probably be creating a quiz for individuals to study. The quiz will be able to store questions and answers submitted by the user.
- This is a program which would require complexity and multiple uses.
- We have determined that this project will retain our interest through the rest of the trimester. It can be used for our future use.
- A quiz taking program can be used by other students in the future or be sponsored by teachers for a specific class(ex. be tailored for vocab of a class). Students can save questions and answer sets for them to use to study.
- The program will be able to used for the CollegeBoard create task. The uses data abstraction, has a level of complexity, has lists and dictionaries, will store data, and is obviously able to be tested and used. This would satisfy all the requirements for the Create Task.
