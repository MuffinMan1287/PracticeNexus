# Standards hit so far
I believe that the class has taught me about the systems development process, through our project, create effective interfaces between humans and technology, through the multiple activities this year, develop software using programming languages, especially through blogging code in fastpages, test, debug, and improve software development work, through the project, and develop Web and online projects, which we are currently doing in our project.

# Looking forward
I am looking forward to hitting the standard: Develop software for a variety of devices, including robotics. I think it will be interesting to see more applications of code and how we can create more projects to help benefit people. I am also looking forward to furthering my skills in standards which have already been met.

# Careers that Benefit
I believe that Data Scientists and Data Analysts benefit from this pathway. Also, business owners could benefit from learning code which can help them complete tasks and design their own website.
