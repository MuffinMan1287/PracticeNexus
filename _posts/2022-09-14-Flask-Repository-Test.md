## Problems

While running main.py, I faced some challenges in creating the website. For me, the `flask_login` and `flask_migrate`, were not being recognized. The problem turned out to be that the 2 programs were not in the right Python version. To solve this, I had to make sure that the `flask_login` and `flask_migrate` were downloaded in the correct Python.

## Hacks

I changed the text in the stub.html file. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/RenamingStubby.png "Stubby Body")

I also worked on a group repository with my team.

## Other Stuff

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/flaskchanges.png "Changed the Page")

In addition, I learned a little bit about HTML. I added an image of Shrek to the webpage. I also changed the size and color of the heading on the page. On the left most box, I removed a highlight and added another description line.
