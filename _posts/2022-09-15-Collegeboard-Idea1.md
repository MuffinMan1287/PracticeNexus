## Notes
- Large companies need to work together to create things
- Ex. Facebook has to manage multiple departments for multiple apps
- *Computing innovation*: Includes a **program** has an integral part of its function
- Computing innovation can be physical(Oculus), nonphysical software(Facebook), or a nonphysical concept(advertising on social media)
- People can work together to develop computing innovations
- It helps to have diverse backgrounds in each teammate, and this will help in creating quality programs.
- Important to: Communicate, Get a Consensus, Negotiate, Resolve Conflicts
- *Pair programming*: Two programmers working together in a pair. One person writes the code, while the other reviews the code
- *Think-Pair-Share*: Students think on their own, then pair up to share ideas, and then share with the class
- Leaving comments on code help partners see what you are doing, and help you stay oriented.
- Also use comments to **cite sources** in your code.

## About my Scrum Team
My scrum team for this trimester will be me, Tay, Luke, and Aditya. We are not a group based on friends or common interests. We are diverse in perspectives and backgrounds. We come from various grade levels, which contributes to the different backgrounds which we have. Our group will succeed in the classroom, as we are hard workers, and we are willing to put in the effort to learn.
